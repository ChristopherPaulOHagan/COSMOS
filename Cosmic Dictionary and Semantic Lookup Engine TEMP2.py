# This is a manifesto of a cosmic endeavour, which was stubled across by a man named Christopher Paul O'Hagan who in his life time spent wondering about the cosmos and went to work in over 300 industries and obtained over 20+ Foundational Certificates from Tafe Victoria and other various colleges. The Cosmos merely handed him the map when he decided to retire and merely watch movies when AI was released to the world. Then fun began.
